# Week 3
Folder for Enron Email Dataset ciphertexts

example of how to use the script (once you have imported the public keys for everyone)

./encrypt4class.sh mwilkes-randon-enron-email.txt

which will create a file called mwilkes-randon-enron-email.txt.gpg

you should add the .gpg file to the repo, not the .txt file
